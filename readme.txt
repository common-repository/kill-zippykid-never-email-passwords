This plugin has no interface, it just prevents ZippyKid's "Never Email Passwords" function from working.

== Description ==

ZippyKid, for all of their fine points, will always send 2 emails when a user signs up for your site if you're using any sort of non-standard registration.  This plugin prevents ZK from messing with peoples' passwords.  This plugin has no interface or settings, just turn it on and escape from the tyranny of a hosting company trying to control how your site works.  Fight the power!

== Installation ==
Just activate it.  There are no settings, it just unhooks their Never Email Passwords must-use plugin.
